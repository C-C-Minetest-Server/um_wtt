# Wire Transfer Terminal for Unified Money

This mod provides a digital way to do transactions. The code is rewritten, while the formspecs and textures are taken from [LinuxForks's version](https://git.bananach.space/atm.git).

Unlike LinuxForks's version, this mod uses [in-game mail](https://content.minetest.net/packages/mt-mods/mail/) to notify the receipt instead of maintaining a log.
